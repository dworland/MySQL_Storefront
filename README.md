# **MySQL_Storefront**

### **Overview** 

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app also provides a manager with options to create products and add to the inventory.

### **Challenge #1: Customer**

Running the app will first display all of the items available for sale that I created a table called `products` within a MySQL Database called `bamazon`. Please see bamazon.sql for how the database and table were created. The app will then prompt the user to select which product and how many units they would like to buy. Finally, the application checks if the database has enough of the proudct to fulfill the user's request.

### **Challenge #2: Manager**

Running bamazonManager.js will list a set of menu options for the manager. The manager has the ability to view products for sale, view low inventory, add quantity to the inventory, and add new products to the database table.
